  comment: >-  
   "高專柔道~歷史に生きる得意技", a Japanese documentary/instructional with Kimura himself. Almost 2 hours of techniques, most of them showing standing-to-ground transitions. Also some interesting interleaved segments on Kyoto's Butoku-kai and it's pre-war role, described in a rather subdued way.
