    The history of Kawaishi-sensei, and as such also largely the
    history of French Judo itself, in a documentary filled with
    interesting archival footage and a comprehensive view of his life.
    From being the undisputed pioneer and leader of French Judo to the
    conflict with the Kodokan, echoing similar tensions elsewhere
    fueled by the differing views on what Judo was or should be - the
    removal of techniques being one of those aspects, given Kawaishi's
    personal method of teaching.
