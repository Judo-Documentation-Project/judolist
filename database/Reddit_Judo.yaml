    To my knowledge, /r/judo is currently the most active Judo-related
    forum-like community in the English language. It brings with it
    all the advantages and disavantages of Reddit, from the wide reach
    and active moderation, to a bias towards the immediate that
    hinders attempts at long-term discussions. The wiki is very
    useful, itself a curated list of resources about techniques,
    history, FAQs, and more. Almost impossible to avoid.
