  description: >-  
    Inoue Shōji (1927-2018) was born in Tokushima prefecture, Japan.
    As a youngster he took up jūdō. Later, he studied Kitō-ryū jūjutsu
    for some time with Odaka Shigeru. During his professional career
    as a prison guard he followed up on an offer to become a jūdō
    therapist. In a dōjō in the Yamashina-ku ward in Kyōto he taught
    both jūdō and a limited catalogue of Kitō-ryū that included
    exercises that were adopted into Kōdōkan jūdō under the name
    koshiki-no-kata [The Antique Forms]. With Kōdōkan jūdō continuing
    to deteriorate into an ordinary sport and losing its core values
    and purpose, Inoue increasingly appreciated the traditional
    martial arts values preserved in Kitō-ryū jūjutsu. His enthusiasm
    was reflected in beginning to give public demonstrations at
    various events in Japan and becoming a representative of Kitō-ryū
    in the Nihon Kobudō Kyōkai. Inoue’s supreme moment of glory likely
    was his public demonstration in 2013 at the occasion of the Fifth
    International Judo Federation (IJF) World Kata Judo Championships
    held in Kyōto. It was this performance that introduced him to the
    international jūdō community and brought him certain fame. For
    most foreign jūdōka this was their first contact with Kitō-ryū.
    Irrespective of the quality of Inoue’s display, his approach
    offered a counterweight against the Kōdōkan’s historic reinvention
    and the IJF sports kata caricature. Several video clips publicly
    available on YouTube remain as a lasting memory of his art. Inoue
    Shōji held the rank of Kōdōkan 8th dan, and peacefully died in
    Kyōto on October 30th, 2018.
