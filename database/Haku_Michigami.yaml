    As Gracey Jujutsu had Mitsuyo Maeda as an inspiration, Haku
    Michigami was behind the globalization of judo. ï¿¼ In the 1964
    Tokyo Olympics, Anton Geesink triggered the turning point of the
    globalization of judo when he won the open weight class finals.
    The man who trained him was "Haku Michigami". Haku Michigami's
    dramatic story filled with events is presented.    
  comment: >-  
    Very interesting page, with many different stories of Haku
    Michigami. Epecially interesting are the accounts about the
    differences between pre-war and post-war Judo, the Butokukai
    (through its students) and the Kodokan, and the conflict between
    different conceptions of what Judo should be. Also, his account of
    training Geesink almost as a way to fight the Kodokan by proxy is
    very engaging.
