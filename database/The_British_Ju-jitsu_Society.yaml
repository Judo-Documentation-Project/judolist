    In the United Kingdom (U.K.) in the late Victorian and early
    Edwardian eras there was an explosion in the popularity of the
    Japanese martial art jujutsu, with seemingly invincible Japanese
    exponents touring and taking on all comers in the music halls. As
    this early wave of popularity subsided a number of organisations
    were established to continue the practice of jujutsu, and other
    Japanese martial arts. Most notable of these was The Budokwai in
    London, established in 1918 by Gunji Koizumi, which from 1920
    would become one of the foremost judo clubs in the West. Recent
    discoveries shed light on another organisation from this era
    called the British Ju-jitsu Society (BJS). Established in 1926,
    the BJS co-existed with The Budokwai and had member clubs
    throughout the U.K. Here, we provide an overview of the BJS, its
    activity, and insights into its operation and legacy.

  comment: >-
    An enticing read on the history of jujutsu and Judo in the UK, covering well-known names like Raku and GK, but delving into not commonly known details of the often complex network of persons and styles that characterise a Judo dispersion that is more varied than the assumed "single origin" view. The characters mentioned are also important in other countries since several of them toured Europe and left their influence - and often disciples.
