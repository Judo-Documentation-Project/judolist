     This channel discusses martial arts topics, history, and the
     forgotten legends of these beautiful arts.
  comment: >-
     A frequently updated channel with commented versions of old (and
     often forgotten) footage, with a heavy bias towards history of
     Judo from a "traditional" viewpoint, but also including other
     martial arts. A polarising channel, but certainly one of the most
     popular ones.
