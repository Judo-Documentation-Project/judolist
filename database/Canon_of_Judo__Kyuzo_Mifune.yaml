     The Canon of Judo is a book that was originally published in
     1956, and written by Kodokan 10th dan, Kyuzo Mifune (1883-1965).
     The book covers almost all of the Kodokan recognized techniques,
     adds variations and new techniques, including Do-Jime in passing
     as well. The book also describes fifteen Kata developed by Mifune
     to teach adaptation through reversal and counters. The book
     organizes the techniques differently from the official Kodokan
     Gokyo.
  comment: A classic reference by Mifune himself, contains techniques not often found elsewhere. Also contains a number of kata outside the official canon, some of them practiced worldwide.
