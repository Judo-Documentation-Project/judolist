    This short documentary tells the story of Doug Rogers, a young
    Canadian athlete who developed a talent for judo that led him into
    competition for the world championship at the Tokyo Olympics and
    subsequent competition at the Pan-American Games. The film shows
    the intensive judo training Rogers took at a Tokyo college, as
    well as glimpses of his life in Japan.    
  comment: >-  
    A classic, a personal account of training in Japan in the 60s. Doug trains, amongst others, with Kimura. Engaging storyline about the life of someone who left everything known to live in Japan.
