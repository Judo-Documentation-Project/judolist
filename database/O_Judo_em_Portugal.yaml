     The history of Judo in Portugal (Portuguese Judo Federation, 1959-2009).
  comment: >-  
     This documentary is split in 4 relatively small parts (5-10m
     each), totalling around 30m. It actually starts a bit before the
     mentioned date (specifically in 1947 with the Budo Academy), but
     quickly proceeds to the arrival of Kobayashi Kiyoshi (1925-2013,
     Kodokan 9th dan), a student of Mifune that due to his role is
     called "the father of Portuguese Judo", the creation of the
     Federation, and the sporting sucesses in the 80s and beyond.
