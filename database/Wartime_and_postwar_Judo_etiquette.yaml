    The present study aimed to clarify the establishment of Judo
    etiquette during the wartime and postwar periods. Nakamura (2011)
    discussed Japanese martial arts etiquette in modern Japan. In his
    work, however, he dealt largely with Kendo etiquette, and
    inadequately addressed the history of Judo, as well as overlooking
    the period of Allied occupation (1945–1952). This article focuses
    on the reformation of Judo etiquette in that period and clarifies
    its historical background.

  comment: >-  
     Interesting paper, with several even more interesting parts
     "hidden" beneath the English abstract about the history of
     etiquette at the Kōdōkan, including the criticism of Inaba Taro
     not only about the way that shizen hontai bowing was
     disrespectful (on (State?) Shintō grounds), but more generally
     that Judo's principles - seiryoku zenyo and jita kyoei - were
     "Western thought" and that the only principle should be "Japanese
     spirit" (there's little room for benign interpretations on what
     he meant by this). Also mentions that the re-establishment of
     wartime etiquette in the 60s was made without any mentions to the
     State Shinto links.
