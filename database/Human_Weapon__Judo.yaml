     Human Weapon is a television show on History Channel that
     premiered on July 20, 2007. The hosts, Jason Chambers and Bill
     Duff, traveled around the world studying the unique martial arts,
     or styles of fighting, that have origins in the region.

     The typical Martial Arts documentary angle on how it works, how
     dangerous it can be, some history, some sparring. For a general
     audience, fun to watch.
