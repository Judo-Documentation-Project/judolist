  comment: >-  
     The history of Judo in Brazil. The GloboPlay link requires
     subscription, the video links point to the only available copy
     found, which isn't the best quality possible (it's made using a
     camcorder) but is perfectly viewable. While not an in-depth view
     of Judo's development in Brazil, it touches on several key
     aspects like the Japanese community, Maeda, etc.
