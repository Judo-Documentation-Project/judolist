    Throw Down (traditional Chinese: 柔道龍虎榜; simplified Chinese: 柔
    道龙虎榜) (Judo Dragon and the Tiger List) is a 2004 Hong Kong
    martial arts film directed by Johnnie To and starring Louis Koo,
    Aaron Kwok, Cherrie Ying, and Tony Leung Ka-fai. To dedicated
    the film to the late Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa and, in
    making it, had drawn upon elements of Kurosawa's debut feature,
    Sanshiro Sugata. Throw Down had its premiere at the 61st Venice
    International Film Festival.   
  comment: >-
    Description says most of it. A singular movie in the way that
    fight scenes are choreographed with and around Judo, not something
    very common. The link to Sanshiro Sugata is clear, but the pace
    and visuals have Johnnie To's signature.
