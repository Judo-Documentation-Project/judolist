    Yawara! (also stylized as YAWARA!) is a Japanese manga series
    written and illustrated by Naoki Urasawa. It was serialized in Big
    Comic Spirits from 1986 to 1993, with its chapters collected into
    29 tankōbon volumes by publisher Shōgakukan. The story centers
    around Yawara Inokuma, a seemingly ordinary high school girl, but
    her grandfather, a living judo legend, has been secretly training
    her since she was a child so that she can win the gold medal at
    the Olympic Games. But Yawara has only one desire, to have a
    normal life (...) That same year, Kitty Films and Madhouse began
    an anime adaptation titled Yawara! A Fashionable Judo Girl!. It
    was broadcast on Yomiuri TV from October 1989 through September
    1992, for 124 episodes. Each episode ended with a countdown of
    days remaining to the start of the Barcelona Olympics

    A popular anime domestically (it competed/paired with with Ranma 1/2 in the late 80s), but lesser known internationally. A Judo-themed anime with comedy and romantic elements, and with the Barcelona Olympics in the background.
