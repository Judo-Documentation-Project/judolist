     My name is Shintaro Higashi and I Love martial arts. I have
     trained in Judo, Brazilian Jiujitsu, Japanese jujutsu, Boxing,
     wrestling, sambo, karate and more! When I am not teaching of
     training at my dojo (Kokushi Budo Institute), you can find me in
     the gym, working on my properties, and playing with my amazing
     daughter. This is what I do. I would like to share with you my
     Judo and BJJ techniques through this channel. Please let me know
     what I can do to help.

     While this also includes the podcast videos (which are listed separarely here), the YouTube channel has more content: training sessions, technique videos, workouts, competition footage, etc. In particular, there is a lot of content on combinations, technique improvement, variations, etc.
