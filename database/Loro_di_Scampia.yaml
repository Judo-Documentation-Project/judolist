    In Scampia, the Camorra hires young people from an early age to
    make them lookouts, drug couriers or hit men. Here is Enzo
    Capuano's gym, where he teaches judo to the boys of the
    neighborhood, tearing them from the street.
  comment: >-  
    Based on the true story of Gianni Maddaloni, a judo coach that for
    decades used Judo has a safe heaven and school of values in one of
    the poorest and most dangerous neighbourhoods in Naples, and his
    son Pino. It shows several reasonably realistic training sessions
    and competition scenes - with leg grabs, I might add, since the
    European Championship was in 1999 and the Olympics was in Sidney
    2000. In terms of the "martial art dojo used to help raise the
    prospects of a poor neighborhood" type, it's very decent,
    certainly so compared with some of the alternatives I've see from
    other martial arts - not the least because even in this more
    light-hearted registry, Italian cinema has a tradition of
    neo-realism that pops up in ways that are hard to match.

    Links include the trailer, a working copy of the movie in Daily
    Motion, and the Netflix entry.
