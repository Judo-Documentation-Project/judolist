    In February 1921, catch wrestlers Ad Santel and Henry Weber
    traveled to Japan to engage in several public bouts against
    fighters from the Kōdōkan judo school. The matches were held in a
    sumo ring at Tokyo’s Yasukuni shrine and became a mega-event,
    attracting between 20,000 and 25,000 spectators. The Kōdōkan judo
    headquarters and the center’s founder Kanō Jigorō positioned
    themselves in opposition to the bouts to protect the Kōdōkan
    brand. What became known as the ‘Santel Incident’ (Santeru jiken)
    caused major controversy in Japan’s judo community. To understand
    the significance of the Santel Incident in the history of Kōdōkan
    judo, this article focusses on the aspects of medialization,
    commercialization, and eventization of sports, thus placing the
    bouts within the larger context of contemporary Japanese and
    global sport history. We demonstrate that the challenge by the
    American professional wrestlers brought to the surface
    generational tensions as well as divergent visions concerning the
    definition of judo between sports and martial art, and
    professionalism and amateurism

    This paper places the infamous Ad Santel episode in historical
    context, going beyond the surface and using contemporary primary
    sources to contextualise what happened in terms of the tension
    between different ideas of what should should be - and in doing
    so, it touches of quite "modern" topics like the place of newaza
    in Judo, the sport vs martial art relationship, and more.
