    Interesting in many ways, but especially in how it breaks the
    excessive formality of kata performance that has became the rule
    (and which, arguably, was not always the case). A light-hearted
    performance of the most recent Judo kata, an interesting example
    of kata as real practice and (not only) cerimony.
