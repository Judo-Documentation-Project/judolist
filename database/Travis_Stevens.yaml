    My name is Travis Stevens and I have been grappling for most of my
    life in one way or another. The purpose of this channel is to
    teach everyone the concepts that helped me go from an average
    teenage kid to the Olympic Podium in Judo! I have grappled at the
    highest levels being a 3x United States Judo Olympian for the 81kg
    weight class. I'm also a BJJ black belt under Renzo Gracie and
    John Danaher! I pride myself on honesty and being straightforward.
    I have a very direct way of teaching. You won't find any really
    flashy moves on my channel that look good but donâ€™t work when your
    training. I only show and display techniques that I have either
    been caught in or have caught people in consistently. Tricks are
    nice to have but let's build a strong foundation of grappling so
    we can compete with anyone in the world.

    Techniques, video breakdowns of competition footage, commentary on
    competition results, there's something for everyone in the channel
    of USA Olympic judoka Travis Stevens. Lots of content spanning
    more than a decade, interesting and useful for all levels.
