     My name is Sampson Sampson. I'm an 9th dan judo coach with over
     49 years experience and I've created this channel to be an online
     judo resource that I hope will help you to take your judo, BJJ or
     grappling to the next level. I regularly release both traditional
     and nogi judo videos that show you how to do judo throws, how to
     do judo hold downs, some tutorials for judo newcomers (such as
     how to do judo breakfalls) as well as well as some vlogs where I
     discuss some of my thoughts about the current state of modern
     judo.
     During my career I have fought extensively across multiple
     federations within Great Britain and internationally as part of
     the Cypriot National Judo team - which I later helped coach for
     events such as the European Championships and the 1984 Olympic
     Games in Los Angeles. I hope that through this channel I can pass
     on my experiences to you and help you to become a better judoka
     one video at a time.

     The channel of Sampson Sampson, currently head coach of Sobell Judo Club in London, and president of Judo For All UK, having separated from the BJC at the time of the leg-grab ban. A vocal defender of "Traditional Kodokan Judo", the channel contains not only technique videos for the more obvious waza, but a wider range that includes leg grabs, picks, counters, and no-gi judo. The channel also contains a podcast where Sampson talks about his own path and other topics.
