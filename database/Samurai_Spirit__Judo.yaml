      Samurai Spirit was a TV documentary on NHK World from 2008 to
      2009, focusing on the traditional martial arts of Japan. It was
      hosted by Nicholas Pettas, a Kyokushin Karate practioner and
      former K-1 Grand Prix champion.      
  comment: This is the Judo episode. Focus on the "ippon" as a (quasi-philosofical) goal, visits Nippon Sport Science University, several well-known Japanese judoka are interviewed (like Kosei Inoe), and the mechanical principles of Judo demonstrated.
