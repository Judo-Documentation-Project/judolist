    The Kanō Chronicles: The Untold History of Modern Japan® (嘉納歴代
    史:知らず近代日本史®) is the result of over 15 years of research
    into the life and times of Kanō Jigorō, 嘉納治五郎 (1860-1938),
    the founder of jûdô 柔道. In traditional jūdō texts and by today’s
    jūdōka 柔道家 (judo practitioners) he is normally addressed as
    ‘Kano shihan’ 師範 (Master Kano).
    No English or Japanese language biographies of Kano shihan capture
    the complexity of the man and his times. Even the best Japanese
    biographies are often narrow, typically focused on Kano’s jūdō,
    education, sports, or Olympic activities, or some combination
    thereof. There are exceptions, but they are rare and difficult to
    digest, even for native Japanese, and have escaped the attention
    of Western researchers.

    Written by Lance Gatling, this is a fundamental resource for
    anyone seriously looking for a better understanding of the history
    of Judo and Kano Jigoro himself. Highly recommended.
