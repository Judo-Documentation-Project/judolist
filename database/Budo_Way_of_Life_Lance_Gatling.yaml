  comment: >-  
    A 2h30m interview that covers a lot of ground, and should be
    mandatory listening to anyone interested in the history of Judo.
    Lance Gatling is one of the few people doing active research that
    can access often forgotten Japanese resources, and this interview
    is one excellent introduction to the work he's been publishing in
    _The Kano Chronicles_ and elsewhere. What Judo 


    Judo, Budō, the very theme of what is Judo all about, the way it
    is interwoven into the very fabric of Imperial Japan history since
    the fin de siècle, the way WW2 impacted our perception (and
    perhaps even more than our perception) of Judo, and the very idea
    we have of Kano that sidesteps what is considered inconvenient -
    including the political aspects of being a key individual during
    the period of growing Japanese imperialism that somehow get
    completely ignored in the official hagiography, to the extent that
    it makes it difficult to understand what actually happened, all is
    mentioned in this interview.
