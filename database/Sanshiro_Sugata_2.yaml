    Kurosawa’s first film was such a success that the studio leaned on the director to make a sequel. The result is a hugely entertaining adventure, reuniting most of the major players from the original and featuring a two-part narrative in which Sanshiro first fights a pair of Americans and then finds himself the target of a revenge mission undertaken by the brothers of the original film’s villain.
  comment: >-  
   Released closer to the end of the war, this sequel parallels the way Judo (and everything else) was being mobiled in the spirit of total war: through it's protagonists, Judo faces western boxing, Japan faces the USA. The outcome is what would be expected, in a film that manages to retain Kurosawa's touch.
