    The judo nomad project consist of traveling to all the 197
    countries with as less flight as possible. I am teaching judo for
    free everywhere and live based on the donation as this project is
    a community project. We will build a community of Judo nomads for
    the future but also other martial arts and be all connected
    together for peace, discipline and fun

    A travel log with a twist, Julien Brulard shares some unique
    insights into how Judo is practiced, at different levels, all over
    the world. A testament to the universal nature of Judo, with a
    varied but always interesting coverage of different realities,
    including rare perspectives and conversations with high-level
    competition teams. Highly recommended.
