    Judo network and forum
  comment: >-  
    One of the successor forums to the late judoforum.com, created
    after the decable, and the most direct descendent as far as I can
    tell; activity peaked after the event, and currently it seems to
    suffer from the same general decline in forum usage. Still, lots
    of threads with that "classical" feeling of when long-term
    discussions were possible (a format lost on the "modern"
    alternatives"), and an overall civilised commmunity.
