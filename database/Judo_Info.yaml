    The purpose of the Judo Information Site is to promote Judo around
    the world by educating the general public and Judo students about
    the various benefits of Judo. Judo can be more than an Olympic
    sport or a martial art. It is a way of life for many people who
    practice it. This site allows the learning to continue off the
    mat, providing a reference tool for students and coaches to gain a
    more complete understanding of the richness of Judo. Background:
    The Judo Information Site went online in June 1995. It is one of
    the oldest martial arts sites online, and the first site to
    provide a wealth of information about any martial art. The Judo
    Information Site is the original, often-copied, information
    source. Over 12 million people have visited, with more than
    200,000 visits each month. The worldâ€™s largest online Judo dojo

    JudoInfo is one of the mainstays of the Judo online community,
    crated by Neil Ohlenkamp, US judoka and a USJA 6th dan; Neil was
    one of the pioneers of the Judo online presence, with JudoInfo
    being one of them, and JudoForum (RIP) the other. This is an
    excellent reference site that contains a lot of material to
    explain what Judo is to a general public, but also to those more
    seriously invested in Judo history.
