    Also known as the Kito-ryu no kata, this is not only an
    interesting historical document of the founder of Judo but also
    ties with the theme of Judo as a vehicle for preservation of koryu
    jujutsu, specifically in this case Kito-ryu (from which Judo can
    be said to be a descendent).
