   A short documentary, intimist and inspirational, on Chris Bacon,
   amongst other things former Commonwealth Judo Champion and Olympic
   judoka - "Judo was my first love". No actual Judo shown (the
   training is around boxing, which Chris has also done to a high
   degree), the documentary being focused on the hard path of elite
   competition and how it relates to daily life.
