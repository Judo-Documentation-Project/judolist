    The official Kodokan page and video channel. An essential
    resource, not the least for the technique videos and kata
    instructions, which are considered the gold standard. Also
    includes the live streams of relevant yearly events (like the
    Kagami Biraki cerimony). Mostly in Japanese, but quote often with
    English subtitles.
