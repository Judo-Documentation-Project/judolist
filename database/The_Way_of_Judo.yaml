    Judo is an Olympic sport that has become popular around the world.
    The story of the birth and development of Judo is told from the
    perspective of those close to Kano Jigoro, the founder of Kodokan
    Judo, in Japan. The life of Kano Jigoro has been animated ahead of
    the Paris Olympics to be held in the summer of 2024 in France,
    Europe's leading judo powerhouse.
  comment: >-  
    Japanese animation of the life of Kano Jigoro. Tells a pretty
    standard "approved" Kodokan version of the events, which is
    unsurprising since it's supervised by the Kodokan. The 5 episodes
    pick different themes: Kano through the words of Katsu Kaishū, 6
    statues of Kano worldwide, the truth about Sanshiro (the "fights
    against jujutsu" that would end up in Sanshiro Sugata, here
    showing Tsunejiro Tomita as Kodokan's champion), the initial
    expansion as "jujutsu", and the spreading out to the world.
