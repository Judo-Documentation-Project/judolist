    Our YouTube channel's goal is to provide fundamentally sound and
    technically innovative skills that will benefit everyone in the
    martial arts. We focus on bringing you videos on Kodokan Judo,
    Sambo and Shingitai Jujitsu that everyone in the grappling and
    combat sports as well as the martial arts may find useful.
    The Welcome Mat Judo, Jujitsu and Sambo Club was formed in 1969 in
    Kansas City, Missouri. Our athletes and coaches have travelled the
    world competing, training and coaching and bring this experience
    to our channel. Steve Scott is the club's founder and Head
    Technical Director. Our videos feature the coaches and athletes at
    Welcome Mat in addition to other coaches and athletes who support
    our work.

    Loads of technique videos, including material not common elsewhere - armlocks, no gi, etc. On top of the technique videos, there is also content about the history of Judo and interviews with US Judo pioneers.
