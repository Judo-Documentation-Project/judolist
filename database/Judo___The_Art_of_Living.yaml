     The EJU President Sergey Soloveychik says: "The idea to create
     the film _Judo. The Art of Living_ was developed by the European
     Judo Union. The film is aimed specifically at parents of young
     children and teenagers. At the heart of the filmâ€™s message are
     real stories of the people who have been able to call on their
     judo skills in difficult moments of their lives in order to
     survive or find themselves. Nowadays sport plays an important
     role in how authorities and society educates an active young
     generation. Judo can also help parents to educate strong, healthy
     and respectful children."
