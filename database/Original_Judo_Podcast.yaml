    Original Judo Podcast is a podcast about Judo! Season one saw us
    chat with athletes and coaches aiming for Tokyo 2020ne. In season
    2 we're trying to keep it going following a group of athletes and
    coaches and coaches through the Paris 2024 Olympic cycle.
  comment:
    James Austin's podcast, English judoka and winner of several British titles. This is one of the oldest Judo podcasts with steady releases (if not the oldest), and offers a perspective on not only British Judo, but competition analysis, interviews, etc. A great resource to keep in touch with Judo in the UK, Europe, and the world.
