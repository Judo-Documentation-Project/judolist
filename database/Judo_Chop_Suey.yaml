    The Judo Chop Suey Podcast is a show that discusses International
    Judo Federation results, topics, techniques, history, and opinion
    on all things related to Judo. Dave Roman currently holds the rank
    of nidan in Judo and has been a practitioner of Judo for 18
    years. Other grappling sports and topics may be covered from time
    to time, most notably on Brazilian Jiu Jitsu where Dave also holds
    the rank of blue belt.
  comment:
    Dave Roman's podcast is one of the oldest Judo podcasts, and one which has been influential in creating a Judo online community through its episodes. Covering US and worldwide Judo topics, it contains interviews and Dave's perspective on Judo events (and for more than Judo, there's the _After Party_).
