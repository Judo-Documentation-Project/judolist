  comment: >-  
    Unmissable video from Hal Sharp's channel, with some unique (though often reused elsewhere in some cases) footage from Hal's archive. Includes competition, kata, demonstrations, etc. Mifune, Kobayashi Kiyoshi, Kotani, are just some of the names we can see in this 2 hour compilation commented and contextualised by Hal himself.
