    A Judo podcast for Judo players by two Judo players.
  comment: >-
    Juan and Anthony's podcast, Los Angeles-based judoka at the Hollywood Judo Dojo. One of the (if not the) most regular podcasts, covering a lot of ground. An excellent choice for anyone that wants to keep up with the Judo community worldwide and a staple in terms of Judo podcasts.
