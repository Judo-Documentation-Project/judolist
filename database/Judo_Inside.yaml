    In the words of Dave Roman (of Judo Chop Suey podcast fame): if
    you're not following Judo Inside, what the hell is wrong with you?
    A constantly up-to-date coverage of what happens in Judo
    worldwide, an essential resource for anyone even mildly interested
    in Judo, and even more so for those with a more serious commitment.
